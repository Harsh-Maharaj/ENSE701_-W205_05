![SPEED Logo](link-to-logo-if-available) <!-- Replace with actual logo URL if available -->

## **Overview**

Welcome to the **Software Practice Empirical Evidence Database (SPEED)** project! SPEED is an innovative web application designed to help software engineers, researchers, and students access empirical evidence on software engineering practices. The goal is to provide a searchable database that summarizes findings from academic research, making it easier to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

- 📊 **Evidence Summaries**: View summarized findings on various software engineering claims.
- 🛠 **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern and intuitive UI for seamless navigation and interaction.
- 📄 **Documentation Integration**: All relevant documentation is accessible directly within the platform.
- 🔒 **Secure Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 authentication ensures secure access to the system.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (v4 or later)
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (for development)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (v2 or later)

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SPEED.git
   cd SPEED
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

   Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**

   Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

   Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories based on the `.env.example` files provided.
   - Configure the necessary environment variables such as database URIs, API keys, etc.

### **Running the Application**

1. **Start the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application:**

   The application should be running at `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:5000` for the backend.
