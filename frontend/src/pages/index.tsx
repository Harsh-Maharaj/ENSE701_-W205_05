        <h2>About SPEED</h2>
        <p>I am passionate about Evidence-based software engineering and I want to support developersâ€™ decisions about the use of different practices based on evidence and experience rather than possibly unsubstantiated claims.</p>

      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2>Challenges in Accessing Information</h2>
        <p>There is a lot of evidence about claims that are documented in published academic research papers but these are unavailable to many commercial software engineers because: (a) they are behind a paywall, (b) they are written in unfamiliar academic language, and (c) it is difficult to find the trends in evidence to make a decision without a lot of searching, filtering, and reading.</p>
      </section>
      <section className={styles.section}>
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>I want to make this easier for practitioners by doing most of this work and storing the results in a searchable database.</p>
